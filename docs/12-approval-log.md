# Approval log

The mark on every page says a person has seen what is published and approved it.
This is where that person says so, with a date, so the claim rests on a record
rather than on everybody's memory of a conversation.

One rule, the same one the archive applies to a plate marked verified and the
language record applies to a review marked done: **an approval names who, when,
and what it covers.** An approval without those is not an approval.

## 2026-08-20 — the build at `748fdb7`

**Approved by:** Betül Öner, owner.
**How it was reviewed:** all 100 pages rendered from the build and viewed as a
contact sheet, plus close looks at fifteen pages across the four properties, at
360, 1024 and 1440 px, in light and dark.

**What this approval covers**

- The four properties as designed and written: the hub, the archive, the
  business desk and the journal.
- All 100 pages as they stood at this commit, in **English** — the layout, the
  structure, the imagery placeholders, the prices shown, and the English copy.
- The nine automated gates passing: HTML, quality control, conversion copy,
  claims against the legal notice, catalogue integrity, plain-language findings,
  the language record, and a real browser at four widths.

**What this approval does not cover, and cannot**

- **The eleven machine-written languages.** Norwegian, Turkish, Spanish, French,
  German, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese and Hindi have not been
  read by a native speaker. Approving the build is not approving text nobody has
  read. Section 5 of the legal notice says this in public, and `languages.json`
  is where each language changes status.
- **Legal sign-off.** The provisions in the notice were researched, not advised
  on. `docs/09` and the licence terms still want a few hours from a Norwegian
  lawyer.
- **The facts left blank on purpose** — organisation number, registered address,
  the archive's real size, the photographer's city. Nothing here invents them.
- **Anything about a live site.** Nothing was published on this date. The build
  exists in the repository only.

## 2026-08-20 — two architecture decisions

**Decided by:** Betül Öner, owner. Recorded in `docs/05` section 0.

- **Merchant of record: Stripe for everything.** No split between the archive
  and the desk, no Lemon Squeezy. Beta Art is the seller, and therefore owns the
  VAT liability everywhere it sells — including EU OSS for digital sales to
  consumers, where a supplier outside the EU has no threshold. To be confirmed
  with the accountant before the first invoice.
- **The payment service runs on Render, Frankfurt.** The four websites stay on
  Vercel. A website deploy cannot take the till down.

Neither is built. These are decisions about what will be built.

## What would change this record

Each of these is one line in this file when it happens, and none of them are
things a machine can write for you:

- a language reviewed → also set its row in `languages.json`, then run
  `python3 tools/languages.py --write`
- the lawyer's read of `docs/09` and the licence terms
- the first real photograph replacing a placeholder → also `beta-art/plates.json`
- the day the site is actually published, and from which commit
