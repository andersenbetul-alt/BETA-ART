"""A promise on a page has to be a promise in the notice.

Every other gate on this project checks a mechanism: does the HTML parse, does
the contrast pass, does the catalogue record back what the plate claims. None of
them read what the site actually promises a customer, and that turned out to be
where the drift was.

Three real faults, found by hand, are the reason this file exists:

  · The hub promised a refund if a verified plate turned out to be machine-made.
    The legal notice said generated imagery is never accessioned — an intention
    with no remedy — and the archive's own FAQ said refunds were limited to
    delivery failures, contradicting the hub outright.
  · "Within 48 hours" appeared on thirty-one pages and in no terms anywhere.
  · The fourth item on the guarantees card said one thing in English and a
    different thing in Norwegian, on all fifty pages, for the same service.

So: each claim below names the words that state it, the section of the notice
that has to back it, and the wording that would contradict it. A claim that
appears on a page and nowhere in the notice is a promise nobody has to keep.

    python3 tools/claims.py
    python3 tools/claims.py --report   list every page each claim appears on

Exits non-zero on any finding.
