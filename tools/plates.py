"""The catalogue, checked against itself.

`beta-art/plates.json` is the record for every plate: what it shows, where and
when it was taken, on what, whether the RAW is held, whether anyone
recognisable is in it, and whether a release exists. Until now that record
lived inside the HTML, which meant a sentence like "release on file" was a
sentence and nothing more.

This refuses to let the catalogue claim what it cannot back:

  · a plate showing a recognisable person may not be offered for licensing
    without a release recorded against it
  · a plate may not say a photograph is verified while the RAW is not held
  · a plate may not name an image file that does not exist
  · an accession number is issued once — no duplicates, ever, because a
    printed QR label resolves by it

    python3 tools/plates.py            check
    python3 tools/plates.py --report   check, and print the catalogue

Exits non-zero on any finding.
