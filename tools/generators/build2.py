<h1>Why Beta Art exists.</h1>
<p class="lead">Not because the world needed another agency. Because the two things a small
company actually wants — knowing what it will cost, and knowing who is responsible — had become
the two hardest things to get.</p>

<article class="svc-block">
<p class="tag">The starting point</p>
<h2>Two industries stopped answering simple questions</h2>
<p class="prose">Ask a digital agency what a website costs and you get a meeting. Ask who will
do the work and you get a team page. Ask what happens if it is late and you get a silence. Small
companies and individuals are the ones who feel this worst, because they have neither the budget
to absorb a bad outcome nor the procurement department to prevent one.</p>
<p class="prose">At the same time, photography stopped being able to prove itself. An image that
looks like a photograph can now be produced by someone who never left the room. That mattered to
us directly, because the archive side of Beta Art sells photographs — and a photograph that
cannot show where it came from is worth less every year.</p>
<p class="prose">Both problems have the same shape: the buyer cannot verify what they are being
sold. Beta Art is built around fixing that, in both directions.</p>
</article>

<article class="svc-block">
<p class="tag">What that means in practice</p>
<h2>Four commitments, written into the agreement</h2>
<ul class="tick-list">
<li><strong>A written scope and a fixed price before work starts.</strong> Not an hourly estimate.
If the scope changes, you approve the change before anything is built.</li>
<li><strong>A named person is responsible for every delivery.</strong> AI is used where it genuinely
helps — drafting, sorting, research — and never as a substitute for judgement. We will tell you
which parts were machine-assisted if you ask.</li>
<li><strong>You own the result.</strong> Source files, accounts and documentation transfer on full
payment. Nothing is held hostage to keep you on a retainer.</li>
<li><strong>Your material never trains a model.</strong> Where an AI service must be used, the
training-excluded or enterprise mode is used, and we name the service.</li>
</ul>

<article class="svc-block">
<p class="tag">Who</p>
<h2>One studio, in Norway</h2>
<p class="prose">Beta Art is the trading name of a sole enterprise established in Norway and owned
by <strong>Betül Öner</strong> — photographer, proprietor, and the person who answers the email.
The studio runs three connected properties: this one, the
<a href="https://beta-art-archive-bet-art.vercel.app/">photography archive</a>, and
<a href="https://beta-art-journal-bet-art.vercel.app/">Field Notes</a>, the journal that documents
how the archive is built.</p>
<p class="prose">Small is a deliberate choice, and it has a cost we will name: we cannot take
everything, and we will say no to work that needs a team we do not have. What you get in exchange
is that the person who quoted the job is the person who delivers it.</p>

<article class="svc-block">
<p class="tag">Honestly</p>
<h2>What we are not</h2>
<ul class="line-list">
<li><strong>Not a recruiter.</strong> The career services make you better at the process; they do
not find you a job.</li>
<li><strong>Not an SEO shop selling rankings.</strong> Nobody can guarantee a position. We guarantee
the work and document it.</li>
<li><strong>Not a platform reseller.</strong> We recommend the tool your team can maintain, not the
one that pays a commission.</li>
<li><strong>Not big.</strong> If your project needs fifteen people, we will tell you at the brief
stage rather than at the deadline.</li>
